Find cheapest hotel

A hotel chain wishes to create an online portal where users/customer can find cheapest hotel based on certain criteria. For now, they wish to start with three hotels which are Miami Beach, Miami Downtown, Miami Midtown.
Hotel has weekend and weekday rates based on customer types as Regular and Reward. Consider following example with rates.

Miami Beach has weekday rates 80$ for regular customer and 50$ for reward customer. Weekend rates for regular are 110$ and 90$ for reward customer.

Miami Downtown has weekday rates 120$ for regular customer and 100$ for reward customer. Weekend rates for regular customer are 90$ and 80$ reward customer.

Miami Midtown has weekday rates 100$ for regular customer and 70$ for reward customer. Weekend rates for regular customer are 150$ and 130$ for reward customer.

Hotel also has following ratings, but ratings can be consider only in case when rates for 2 hotels are tie/equal.

Miami Beach has 4-star rating.

Miami Downtown has 3-star rating.

Miami Midtown has 5-star rating.
 
With all the above requirement we would like to create a program which gives us cheapest hotel.
